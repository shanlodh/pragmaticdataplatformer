When LLM Degradations Become Insurance Claims

AI hallucinations were a meme in 2023. In 2025, they’re becoming an insured risk as the FT reports (paywall article): https://www.ft.com/content/1d35759f-f2a9-46c4-904b-4a78ccc027df

As someone actively building AI applications this is a terrific development. It reflects growing confidence in the utility of GenAI — but also clear-eyed realism about its risks and concrete measures towards mitigation these risk wherever possible.

Sharing couple extracts from the article that stood out for me: 

- insurance could pay out if a chatbot gave clients or employees correct information only 85 per cent of the time, after initially doing so in 95 per cent of cases
- an insurer at Lloyd’s ... underwriting the policies ... said his group would not sign policies covering AI systems they judge to be excessively prone to breakdown

Insurance = belief that something is here to stay. Now we need better ways to test, log, monitor and govern LLM outputs. Exciting!!
