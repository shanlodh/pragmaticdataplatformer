As a data professional with Economics background, I eagerly awaited 𝐁𝐞𝐧 𝐁𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐤𝐞'𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐝'𝐬 (𝐁𝐨𝐄) 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬, set up following recent macro-economic uncertainty. I wondered how much emphasis the former US Federal Reserve Chairman and Economics Nobel Prize winner would put on 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐦𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨-𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠.

So I was delighted that the review's first major theme highlights "𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡-𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬." Below are this theme's top three recommendations with some of my own references to industry frameworks:

"𝐮𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐬𝐨𝐟𝐭𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐛𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲": macroeconomic forecast is ultimately a machine-learning (ML) pipeline and Uber's Michelangelo framework is one of the earliest and best known in industry. It is a great place to start for overall ML architecture, has excellent documentation, and remains in active use and development with recent features like streaming data, RPC client etc.

"𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐛𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲": cloud providers (SageMaker, Vertex) and other (Weights & Biases) model registry solutions exist, it is also possible to compose hybrid solutions where an institution decides to host some stages on-premises for data residency considerations and plug-and-play metadata functionalities like model registries through these services' REST APIs. The key here is in ML models both code and data must be version controlled, so while Git, GitHub are essential it is critical to have DVC or similar data version control structures in place

"𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚 𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐮𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤": - the current BoE framework (COMPASS) has been in use since Nov 2011, so a review would be useful in any case. It can also be a great opportunity to evaluate emerging time-series foundation models for universal forecasting (e.g., Moirai) and incorporate automated forecast attribution (Shapley values) and forecast drift (both data and model drifts) measures into the framework

The review was a bold call from BoE and kudos to them for going with the best in the field. A strong emphasis on forecast (ML) engineering framework makes me hopeful that a more robust framework will emerge not only to bring value to UK economy but also bridge industry and academic data applications standards.
