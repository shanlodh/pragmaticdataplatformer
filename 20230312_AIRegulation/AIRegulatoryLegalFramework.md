Amidst all the AI excitement a sobering thought is that currently there is no enforceable regulatory and legal framework for AI-enabled products and services offered by private enterprise. The EU Artificial Intelligence Act looks likely to become one of the first pieces of legislation, at scale, in this area. Similar to GDPR, the EU AI Act may even become a template for wider global standards. And more broadly, AI regulation will undoubtedly become a key focus area with market participants like law firms already gearing up for this development (Image 1 below, article link) 

The EU AI Act, like GDPR, will cover any AI system affecting EU citizens irrespective of where these systems are developed or hosted. So whether you are an AI systems provider, user or financier if your AI endpoints reach any EU jurisdiction you need to be aware of the broad provisions of the EU AI Act to ensure your business model is not upended when the Act becomes law 

This post provides an overview of the EU legislative framework, describes the EU AI Act within this framework with a focus on high-risk (including general purpose) AI systems and outlines the timeline to legislation and compliance: 

- EU legislative framework: the [EU decision making process](https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/decision-making-process/legislation_en) involves three main institutions: (a) European Parliament represents EU citizens, (b) Council of the European Union represents EU governments and (c) European Commission represents the EU’s overall interests and is the only institution empowered to initiate legislation. The process to draft, amend, consult and, eventually, legislate across these bodies is described [on the European Parliament's Legislative powers page](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers). It ensures checks and balances between executive and legislative wings of governance with informal tripartite meetings ([trilogue](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2021)690614)) to speed the legislative process

- European Commission (EC) proposals for the EU AI Act (23 April, 2021): As legislation initiator, the [EC proposals](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206) cover following key areas:
  - defining AI systems: includes ML (supervised, unsupervised, RL, DL), logic and knowledge based approaches (representation learning, expert systems), statistical approaches, Bayesian estimation, search and optimisation methods 
  - adopting a risk-based approach to AI differentiating between:
    - unacceptable risks: covers children, persons with disabilities, profiling, real-time biometric id in public spaces (with limited exceptions)
    - high risks: biometric id, IoT for critical infrastructure, access to and assessment in education and training, recruitment, promotion and termination of employment, provision of public services, credit scores, dispatch of first responders, assessment of (re)offending risks and polygraphs, migration, asylum and border controls, judicial assistance 
    - low or minimal risks: all other AI  
  - requirements for high-risk AI systems: covering data governance, documentation and recording keeping, transparency  and provision of information to users, human oversight, robustness, accuracy and security. It also covers the principle of horizontality (synchronisation with related legislation like GDPR), independent third party assessments (EU AI Board) and a EU wide database of high-risk AI systems. All businesses developing AI enabled products and services should review thoroughly [Annex IV (Technical Documentation) and Annex V (Declaration of Conformity)](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/annexes/) detailing auditable dimensions of AI enabled systems. Even if your AI does not come under the Act these sections provide an excellent blueprint for AI platform owners on constructing robust, compliant AI platforms 
  - requirements for minimal-risk AI systems: that companies voluntarily follow a code-of-conduct covering the main tenets of AI systems as described above for high-risk systems 
  - measures in support of innovation such as establishing AI regulatory sandboxes 
  - future scope: the EC proposal mentions that it " ... strengthens significantly the Union’s role to help shape global norms and standards and promote trustworthy AI ...", key reason to assess this Act for broader impact 

- Council of the EU feedback on EU AI Act proposals: On 25 November, 2022 the Council of the EU released it's feedback (called 'General approach') on the EU AI Act proposal. Full document link [here](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14954-2022-INIT/en/pdf) and it addresses all proposed sections described above. A summary of the EU Council's review is [here](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/06/artificial-intelligence-act-council-calls-for-promoting-safe-ai-that-respects-fundamental-rights/) and one worth calling out is with regards to general purpose (GP) AI "... where there may be circumstances where general purpose AI technology gets integrated into another system which may become high-risk". As GP AI powers current AI boom this is an extremely important observation to be aware of and follow to legislation to understand what it means for any AI providers looking to leverage ChatGPT and similar in their business model 

- European Parliament and the EU AI Act proposals: the Parliament has not produced their review yet on the EU AI Act proposals. The parliamentary discussions are being led by two committees and it ["... aims to vote on the text sometime in the first quarter of 2023."](https://iapp.org/news/a/a-look-at-european-parliaments-ai-act-negotiations/)

- EU AI Act next steps, timings and penalties: Once the EU Parliament review is submitted the trilogue process ensues leading to eventual legislation. Calling legislative deadlines is tricky but several commentators (e.g., [here](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisories/2023/01/europe-ai-act-moves-forward)) expect the EU AI Act to pass into law later in 2023. There is usually a two-year grace period ([*vacatio legis*](https://www.responsible.ai/post/eu-ai-act-explained)) from the passage of law to help relevant parties prepare for compliance. Non-compliance with the EU AI Act can be subject to administrative fines of up to EUR 30 million or up to 6 % of total worldwide annual company turnover for preceding financial year, whichever is higher 

AI promises great benefits for individuals, corporates and governments. At the same time we need to ensure any AI enabled system is non-discriminatory and protects users' data privacy. The EU AI Act is one of the first pieces of legislation in this rapidly evolving space. The checks and balances it is striving to implement means building AI systems consistent with regulatory guidelines is not only ethical, it is also sound business practice!
