Agentic coding isn’t a catch all — it’s multi dimensional.

GitHub Copilot (GHCP) in VS Code is my usual coding agent and the way I use it depends on three main dimensions:  project maturity (from greenfield to mature), agent scope (from entire workspace to inline), and agent mode (from explanatory to action taking). As these shift, I recalibrate. 

For example, as the clip below shows: on a greenfield (to the left) it is reasonable to run GHCP across the entire workspace but as the codebase grows, I tighten its scope progressively shifting from workspace to module to evenutally inline while simultaneously dialling down the agent's mode  as well from agentic to editor to explainor; in very mature or inherited codebases (bottom right), explain / ask often wins.

Why dial it down? To build deeper understanding, make safer, reviewable changes, and keep tighter control over a more complex codebase. This also feels like a more productive Copilot relationship between humans and AI — the human stays in command, sets boundaries, reviews diffs, while the coding agent assists rather than roams freely.

These observations come from my day to day with GHCP in VS Code — other agentic coding tools are available but the ideas feel generalisable. Also useful: Copilot Instructions at developer, project, and organisation levels — a fourth dimension that encodes preferences, standards, and guardrails so agent's responses stays aligned as systems evolve.

As the codebase develops transferance of mode and scope from AI to the human also feels like what human - machine interaction was always meant to be — we divide and conquer and lean into our respective strengths. That, to me, is the happy part of working with machines.

Happy (agentic) coding!
