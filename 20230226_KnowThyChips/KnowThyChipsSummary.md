Current AI spring unfolds in an era of mass cloud computing. But rising cloud costs ([cloudflation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/02/23/three-tips-to-navigate-cloud-flation/)) means enterprises must be extremely deliberate how they leverage public cloud and demonstrate clear benefits from doing so. This note describes specialised AI as an area where public cloud offers comparative benefits towards faster GTM with AI 

**"It's all about the chips in the AI war"** (below image, [article link](https://www.ft.com/content/0a16c45f-5739-43ad-abdc-1b91afa83e0d)) as chips drive training and inference on rising volumes of (unstructured) data and ever larger [foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models). But the learning curve and maintenance overheads to deploy optimal chips-per-compute (specially GPUs) are steep. Utilising public cloud for such deployments are thus a key driver in AI-led innovation. Data platform teams help companies succeed with AI by providing such cloud native optimised compute environments with IaC scalability, PEP security and programmatic cost controls  

In short, to win with AI, **data platformers know thy chips**

The article is split into following sections, with brief outlines: 

- **Tabular data - Boosting Algorithms - Intel AI Kit API:** tree algorithms (XGBoost) still outperform on tabular data, utilise the Intel AI Kit API for XGBoost and other scikit-learn estimators

- **Intel AI Kit API - AWS, Azure - Databricks:** AWS, Azure pre-built VM's with the Intel AI Kit and how it can be extended to an entire Databricks cluster  

- **Unstructured data - Foundation Models - GPUs:** GPUs rule unstructured AI models leader boards across image, object, speech and NLP data

- **GPUs - CUDA - Driver, Toolkit, SDK:** Installing GPUs has non-trivial complexity, involving drivers, toolkits and SDKs. But here too pre-built images are available on all cloud providers  

- **Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) - Google TPU, AWS Trainium:** Beyond the NVIDIA ecosystem, if you need ASIC's look at Google TPU and AWS Trainium as per your use case 

- **STOP PRESS: NVIDIA DGX Cloud-AI-As-A-Service:** Watch out for upcoming announcements at the GPU market leader's March developer conference 

Complete article, with links, is available on GitHub: https://github.com/shanlodh/pragmaticdataplatformer/blob/main/004_KnowThyChips/KnowThyChips.md and the main conclusion of the article is: unless creating the AI models themselves is your enterprise's core business focus, **leverage data platform teams to provide secure, cost-effective cloud based AI PaaS solutions to develop a winning AI-enabled offerings strategy**
