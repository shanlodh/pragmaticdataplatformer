Certainly! Hereâ€™s a summary of all the prompts from this chat, organized by sections:
---
### Initial Request
- **Task**: Provide Python 3.10 compatible code to solve first-in, first-out capital gains tax calculations on share transactions using a Pandas DataFrame.
- **DataFrame Columns**: `transactiondate`, `activitydescription`, `security`, `numberunits`, `price`, `currency`, `amount`.
- **Function Requirements**: 
  - Inputs: DataFrame, start date, end date.
  - Output: Capital gains calculations for the specified period.
### Generalization
- **Clarification**: Start and end dates represent the financial year, not all transactions.
- **Requirement**: Account for shares bought in previous years and held into the year of interest.
### Deque Implementation
- **Modification**: Use the `deque` from the `collections` module to manage buys and sells.
### Synthetic Dataset Example
- **Task**: Create a synthetic dataset and demonstrate how the function works.
- **Period**: Transactions between January 2022 and December 2023.
- **Example Usage**: Start date '2023-01-01', end date '2023-12-31'.
### Modularization and Refactoring
- **Requirement**: Return two DataFrames from the function:
  - Capital gains calculations.
  - Remainder with outstanding buy and sell positions.
- **Groupby Operations**: 
  - Extract input DataFrames via groupby.
  - Apply the `calculate_fifo_capital_gains` function.
  - Concatenate results for all securities.
### Debugging and Breakpoints
- **Task**: Guide on setting breakpoints and stepping through the code in VS Code.
- **Explanation**: Role of `launch.json` in debugging.
### Final Function Refactoring
- **Enhancements**: Add type hints, docstrings, and modularize the code.
- **Directory Structure**: Suggest a directory structure for the project.
### Cookiecutter Template
- **Task**: Provide a Cookiecutter template to reflect the project structure.
- **Platform Independence**: Use `pathlib` to read files for platform independence.
### Cookiecutter Summary
- **Components**:
  - `cookiecutter.json`
  - `.gitignore`
  - `hooks/post_gen_project.py`
  - Data directory with `transactions.csv`
  - Source code directory with main script, data loader, FIFO calculator, and utilities.
  - Tests directory with test cases for FIFO calculator and utilities.
  - README.md
