Just noticed the open-source community has kept my StackOverflow account ticking along with regular upvotes, so much so that it hit the StackOverflow 1000+ reputation club last month! Some of you are aware most of my open-source keyboard time is spent other C++ forums and had last posted on StackOverflow more than two years ago. So nice to see that some of the material is still useful to the community
And it did make me think though was: in the age of Codex / Copilot / LLM's is there still a need for forums like StackOverflow?
Naturally I'm biased but hopefully some of the following will resonate: 
- Serendipity of human-human interactions: ChatGPT is great but using it is still a solo experience and does not bring about the chance encounters that spark innovation in unexpected ways. One of the C++ forums I contribute to has a named committeer and at least twice I have read their posts saying a particular issue was not with the code but with the language standards and they'd submit a proposal on the back of the forum thread. Imagine you can contribute to a language framework just by asking asking questions! I am also aware of a few libraries and packages whose co-authors first met on such forums, discovered they were working on similar problems and then joined forces 
- Today's question is tomorrow's training data: my ChatGPT session claims its knowledge cut-off date is Sep 2021. If it's true this was 18 months ago which is a lifetime in modern software development. There would be some many packages and frameworks in the meantime that an up-to-date response will require a forum post. And, think of it this way, today's question is tomorrow's training data 
- Asking good questions is the original prompt engineering: Some programmers I know have mixed views on StackOverflow, true it can seem an opinionated discourse where even newbies have to show examples of what they have tried and a minimal program reproducing the error or describing intended outcome. If you have used any of the LLM's think of these requirements as just establishing high quality prompts and we know that prompt engineering is rapidly becoming a specialization in itself. And the beauty of open source is that there are numerous forums, just find the one that fits well with your style
