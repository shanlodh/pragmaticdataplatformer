My conversation with the #MIT Technology Review and other industry peers on "Readying business for the age of AI" was recorded in May 2024 and was published late Aug (links below). 

Whilst three months seems like a life-time during the current AI tech-cycle, during this session we focused primarily on the underlying, fundamental changes businesses need to make to embrace and leverage AI. Re-reading this article the panel's observations ring truer than ever before.
